- <span class="small-caps">zenroom</span> is a **secure language interpreter** of both Lua and its own secure domain specific language <span class="small-caps">dsl</span> to execute fast cryptographic operations using elliptic curve arithmetics.


- The <span class="small-caps">zenroom vm</span> is very small, has **no external dependency**, is fully deterministic and ready to run **end-to-end encryption** on any platform:
desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud and even web browsers.


- **zenCode** is the name of the <span class="small-caps">dsl</span> executed by <span class="small-caps">zenroom</span>: it is similar to human language and can process large data structures while operating cryptographic transformations and basic logical operations on them.



<span class="small-caps">zenroom</span> _is licensed as <span class="small-caps">agpl</span>v3 we are happy to discuss dual-licensing on a commercial base._
